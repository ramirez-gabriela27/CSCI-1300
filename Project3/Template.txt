    will want to display text file and change it as the game goes on
    (25 rows, 16 columns) make an array and make for loop to print

        points calculator after turn
        split!!!
        display map
        display menu

    location on map (row/column)
    ship/no ship
    *** can get dragonglass

**class for player
    name of player  // to go on results file
    hero            // has choice to create different hero or chose existing
    points          // to go on results file





****** first step!!!!
    initialize the game by reading the files
        create heroes
        place dragonglass in 5 random locations
        if warrior is free - random location
            if they have ship - MUST start on water
        if warrior is not - location == location hero
            cannot be in same location as one of the heroes or other warriors
